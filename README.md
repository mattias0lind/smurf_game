If these don't return anything please download them.

Step 2:
Download our code and zip up the file.

Step 3:
Use the command cd to locate the correct folder (Example below)

Example: C:\Users\andres\Desktop\Test\smurf_game-master\smurf_game-master 
If done correctly on your local machine, your explorer should show a bunch off different maps etc e.g
one called desktop another one called assets etc

Now type: cd C:\Users\andre\Desktop\Test\smurf_game-master\smurf_game-master (In the command line)
